**Apartment Hunt Helper**

*Introduction*
Welcome to Apartment Hunt Helper! This project, developed by CS546 Group 18, aims to streamline the rental property search process by providing users with a platform to search for properties, review landlords, and share experiences.

Features
1. Property Listings and Ratings
Browse through a range of rental properties listed by landlords. Each property comes with detailed information and ratings provided by tenants who have previously lived there.

2. Landlord Listings, Profiles, and Ratings
Access profiles of landlords, including their contact information and a listing of their properties. Tenants can rate and review landlords based on their experiences, helping others make decisions.

3. Tenant Profiles
Create a profile to share your rental history and experiences with the community. 

4. Rating and Review System
Rate and review properties and landlords based on various factors such as maintenance, responsiveness, and overall experience.

5. Community Forum
Engage with other tenants through our community forum. Share tips, ask questions, and discuss rental-related topics with individuals.

6. Moderation and Reporting System
We maintain a moderation system to ensure that the platform remains a space for all users. Report any content or behavior issues on the property listings, and the administrators can take action.

7. Text-Based Search Functionality
Efficiently search for properties, landlords, or topics within the community forum using our text-based search functionality.
